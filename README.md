staqlt | Nuitka Python Optimization Project

This project automates the conversion of Python source code into highly optimized C-based binaries.

How it Works

Source: The core logic resides in main.py.

Automation: compile.js acts as the orchestrator, triggering the Nuitka compiler with specific flags for maximum performance (--standalone, --onefile).

Output: A secure, standalone executable that is resistant to reverse engineering.

Setup

Ensure Python 3.x and Node.js are installed.

Install Nuitka: npm run setup.

Run the compilation: npm start.

Core Services Used

Process Automation: Streamlining the compilation and deployment pipeline.

AI Integration: (Optional) Used for code analysis and pattern recognition for optimization.
